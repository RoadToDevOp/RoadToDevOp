- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Eoghan
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in becoming a devops engineer in the future, after discovering the role I have taken great fascination in diving deep into good practices, learning python to a deeper level, and picking up Go. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Advanced Python, AZ/AWS, Bash, Linux OS, Virtualisation
- âš¡ Fun fact: Used to compete professionally in games! Now looking to take that mindset to good work ethic :)!
